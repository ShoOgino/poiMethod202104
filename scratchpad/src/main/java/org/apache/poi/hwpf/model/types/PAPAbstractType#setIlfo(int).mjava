     * "A 16-bit signed integer value that is used to determine which list

     *
     * 0x0000 -- This paragraph is not in a list, and any list formatting on the
     * paragraph is removed.
     *
     * 0x0001 - 0x07FE -- The value is a 1-based index into PlfLfo.rgLfo. The
     * LFO at this index defines the list that this paragraph is in.
     *
     * 0xF801 -- This paragraph is not in a list.
     *
     * 0xF802 - 0xFFFF -- The value is the negation of a 1-based index into
     * PlfLfo.rgLfo. The LFO at this index defines the list that this paragraph
     * is in. The logical left indentation (see sprmPDxaLeft) and the logical
     * left first line indentation (see sprmPDxaLeft1) of the paragraph MUST be
     * preserved despite any list formatting. By default, a paragraph is not in
     * a list."
