     * Add an image to a worksheet.
     *
     * @param cellNumber A String that contains the location of the cell whose
     *                   top left hand corner should be aligned with the top
     *                   left hand corner of the image; for example "A1", "A2"
     *                   etc. This is to support the familiar Excel syntax.
     *                   Whilst images are are not actually inserted into cells
     *                   this provides a convenient method of indicating where
     *                   the image should be positioned on the sheet.
     * @param sheet A reference to the sheet that contains the cell referenced
     *              above.
     * @param drawing An instance of the DrawingPatriarch class. This is now
     *                passed into the method where it was, previously, recovered
     *                from the sheet in order to allow multiple pictures be
     *                inserted. If the patriarch was not 'cached in this manner
     *                each time it was created any previously positioned images
     *                would be simply over-written.
     * @param imageFile An instance of the URL class that encapsulates the name
     *                  of and path to the image that is to be 'inserted into'
     *                  the sheet.
     * @param reqImageWidthMM A primitive double that contains the required
     *                        width of the image in millimetres.
     * @param reqImageHeightMM A primitive double that contains the required
     *                         height of the image in millimetres.
     * @param resizeBehaviour A primitive int whose value will determine how
     *                        the code should react if the image is larger than
     *                        the cell referenced by the cellNumber parameter.
     *                        Four constants are provided to determine what
     *                        should happen;
     *                          AddDimensionedImage.EXPAND_ROW
     *                          AddDimensionedImage.EXPAND_COLUMN
     *                          AddDimensionedImage.EXPAND_ROW_AND_COLUMN
     *                          AddDimensionedImage.OVERLAY_ROW_AND_COLUMN
     * @throws java.io.FileNotFoundException If the file containing the image
     *                                       cannot be located.
     * @throws java.io.IOException If a problem occurs whilst reading the file
     *                             of image data.
     * @throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException If an invalid value is passed
     *                                            to the resizeBehaviour
     *                                            parameter.
