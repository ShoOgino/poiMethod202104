     * This process can be relatively slow on large sheets, so this should
     *  normally only be called once per column, at the end of your
     *  processing.
     * </p>
     * You can specify whether the content of merged cells should be considered or ignored.
     *  Default is to ignore merged cells.
     *
     *  <p>
     *  Special note about SXSSF implementation: You must register the columns you wish to track with
     *  the SXSSFSheet using {@link #trackColumnForAutoSizing(int)} or {@link #trackAllColumnsForAutoSizing()}.
     *  This is needed because the rows needed to compute the column width may have fallen outside the
     *  random access window and been flushed to disk.
     *  Tracking columns is required even if all rows are in the random access window.
     *  </p>
