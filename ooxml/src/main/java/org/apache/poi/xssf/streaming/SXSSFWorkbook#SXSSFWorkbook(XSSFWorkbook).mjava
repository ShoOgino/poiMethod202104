    /**
     * <p>Construct a workbook from a template.</p>
     *
     * There are three use-cases to use SXSSFWorkbook(XSSFWorkbook) :
     * <ol>
     *   <li>
     *       Append new sheets to existing workbooks. You can open existing
     *       workbook from a file or create on the fly with XSSF.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *       Append rows to existing sheets. The row number MUST be greater
     *       than {@code max(rownum)} in the template sheet.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *       Use existing workbook as a template and re-use global objects such
     *       as cell styles, formats, images, etc.
     *   </li>
     * </ol>
     * All three use cases can work in a combination.
     *
     * What is not supported:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>
     *   Access initial cells and rows in the template. After constructing
     *   all internal windows are empty and {@link SXSSFSheet#getRow} and
     *   {@link SXSSFRow#getCell} return <code>null</code>.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *    Override existing cells and rows. The API silently allows that but
     *    the output file is invalid and Excel cannot read it.
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param workbook  the template workbook
