     * TODO: data tables are stored at the workbook level in XSSF, but are bound to a single sheet.
     *       The current code structure has them hanging off XSSFSheet, but formulas reference them
     *       only by name (names are global, and case insensitive).
     *       This map stores names as lower case for case-insensitive lookups.
     *
     * FIXME: Caching tables by name here for fast formula lookup means the map is out of date if
     *       a table is renamed or added/removed to a sheet after the map is created.
     *
     *       Perhaps tables can be managed similar to PivotTable references above?
