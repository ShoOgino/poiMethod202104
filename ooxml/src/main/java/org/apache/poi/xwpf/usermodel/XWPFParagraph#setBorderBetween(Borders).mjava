     * Specifies the border which shall be displayed between each paragraph in a
     * set of paragraphs which have the same set of paragraph border settings.
     * <p>
     * To determine if any two adjoining paragraphs should have a between border
     * or an individual top and bottom border, the set of borders on the two
     * adjoining paragraphs are compared. If the border information on those two
     * paragraphs is identical for all possible paragraphs borders, then the
     * between border is displayed. Otherwise, each paragraph shall use its
     * bottom and top border, respectively. If this border specifies a space
     * attribute, that value is ignored - this border is always located at the
     * bottom of each paragraph with an identical following paragraph, taking
     * into account any space after the line pitch.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If this element is omitted on a given paragraph, its value is determined
     * by the setting previously set at any level of the style hierarchy (i.e.
     * that previous setting remains unchanged). If this setting is never
     * specified in the style hierarchy, then no between border shall be applied
     * between identical paragraphs.
     * </p>
     * <b>This border can only be a line border.</b>
     *
     * @param border one of the defined Border styles, see {@link Borders}
