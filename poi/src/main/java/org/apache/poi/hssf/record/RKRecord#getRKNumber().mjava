     * The mechanism for determining the value is dependent on the two

     * is an integer and can be cast directly as a double, otherwise,
     * it's apparently the exponent and mantissa of a double (and the
     * remaining low-order bits of the double's mantissa are 0's).
     * <P>
     * If bit 0 is set, the result of the conversion to a double is
     * divided by 100; otherwise, the value is left alone.
