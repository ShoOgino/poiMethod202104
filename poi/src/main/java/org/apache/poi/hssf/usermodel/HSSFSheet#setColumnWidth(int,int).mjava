    /**
     * Set the width (in units of 1/256th of a character width)<p>
     *
     * The maximum column width for an individual cell is 255 characters.
     * This value represents the number of characters that can be displayed
     * in a cell that is formatted with the standard font (first font in the workbook).<p>
     *
     * Character width is defined as the maximum digit width
     * of the numbers <code>0, 1, 2, ... 9</code> as rendered
     * using the default font (first font in the workbook).<p>
     *
     * Unless you are using a very special font, the default character is '0' (zero),
     * this is true for Arial (default font font in HSSF) and Calibri (default font in XSSF)<p>
     *
     * Please note, that the width set by this method includes 4 pixels of margin padding (two on each side),
     * plus 1 pixel padding for the gridlines (Section 3.3.1.12 of the OOXML spec).
     * This results is a slightly less value of visible characters than passed to this method (approx. 1/2 of a character).<p>
     *
     * To compute the actual number of visible characters,
     * Excel uses the following formula (Section 3.3.1.12 of the OOXML spec):<p>
     *
     * <code>
     * width = Truncate([{Number of Visible Characters} *
     * {Maximum Digit Width} + {5 pixel padding}]/{Maximum Digit Width}*256)/256
     * </code>
     * <p>Using the Calibri font as an example, the maximum digit width of 11 point font size is 7 pixels (at 96 dpi).
     * If you set a column width to be eight characters wide, e.g. <code>setColumnWidth(columnIndex, 8*256)</code>,
     * then the actual value of visible characters (the value shown in Excel) is derived from the following equation:
     * <code>
     * Truncate([numChars*7+5]/7*256)/256 = 8;
     * </code>
     * <p>
     * which gives <code>7.29</code>.
     *
     * @param columnIndex - the column to set (0-based)
     * @param width       - the width in units of 1/256th of a character width
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if width &gt; 255*256 (the maximum column width in Excel is 255 characters)
