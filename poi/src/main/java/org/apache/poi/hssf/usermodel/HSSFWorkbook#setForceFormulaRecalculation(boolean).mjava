     * Whether the application shall perform a full recalculation when the workbook is opened.
     * <p>
     * Typically you want to force formula recalculation when you modify cell formulas or values
     * of a workbook previously created by Excel. When set to true, this flag will tell Excel
     * that it needs to recalculate all formulas in the workbook the next time the file is opened.
     * </p>

     * Note, that recalculation updates cached formula results and, thus, modifies the workbook.
     * Depending on the version, Excel may prompt you with "Do you want to save the changes in <em>filename</em>?"
     * on close.
