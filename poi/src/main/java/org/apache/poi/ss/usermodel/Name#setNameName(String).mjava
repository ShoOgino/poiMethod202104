    /**
     * Sets the name of the named range
     *
     * <p>The following is a list of syntax rules that you need to be aware of when you create and edit names.</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Valid characters</strong>
     *   The first character of a name must be a letter, an underscore character (_), or a backslash (\).
     *   Remaining characters in the name can be letters, numbers, periods, and underscore characters.
     *   </li>
     *   <li><strong>Cell references disallowed</strong>
     *   Names cannot be the same as a cell reference, such as Z$100 or R1C1.</li>
     *   <li><strong>Spaces are not valid</strong>
     *   Spaces are not allowed as part of a name. Use the underscore character (_) and period (.) as word separators, such as, Sales_Tax or First.Quarter.
     *   </li>
     *   <li><strong>Name length</strong>
     *    A name can contain up to 255 characters.
     *   </li>
     *   <li><strong>Case sensitivity</strong>
     *   Names can contain uppercase and lowercase letters.
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * A name must always be unique within its scope. POI prevents you from defining a name that is not unique
     * within its scope. However you can use the same name in different scopes. Example:
     * <pre><blockquote>
     * //by default names are workbook-global
     * Name name;
     * name = workbook.createName();
     * name.setNameName("sales_08");
     *
     * name = workbook.createName();
     * name.setNameName("sales_08"); //will throw an exception: "The workbook already contains this name (case-insensitive)"
     *
     * //create sheet-level name
     * name = workbook.createName();
     * name.setSheetIndex(0); //the scope of the name is the first sheet
     * name.setNameName("sales_08");  //ok
     *
     * name = workbook.createName();
     * name.setSheetIndex(0);
     * name.setNameName("sales_08");  //will throw an exception: "The sheet already contains this name (case-insensitive)"
     *
     * </blockquote></pre>
    * </p>
     * @param name named range name to set
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the name is invalid or the already exists within its scope (case-insensitive)
     */
    void setNameName(String name);
