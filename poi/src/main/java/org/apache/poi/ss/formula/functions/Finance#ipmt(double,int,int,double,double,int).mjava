	/**
     * Emulates Excel/Calc's IPMT(interest_rate, period, number_payments, PV,
     * FV, Type) function, which calculates the portion of the payment at a
     * given period that is the interest on previous balance.
     * 
     * @param r
     *            - periodic interest rate represented as a decimal.
     * @param per
     *            - period (payment number) to check value at.
     * @param nper
     *            - number of total payments / periods.
     * @param pv
     *            - present value -- borrowed or invested principal.
     * @param fv
     *            - future value of loan or annuity.
     * @param type
     *            - when payment is made: beginning of period is 1; end, 0.
     * @return <code>double</code> representing interest portion of payment.
     *
