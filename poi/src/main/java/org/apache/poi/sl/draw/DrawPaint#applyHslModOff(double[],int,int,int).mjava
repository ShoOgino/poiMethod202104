     * Apply the modulation and offset adjustments to the given HSL part
     *
     * Example for lumMod/lumOff:
     * The lumMod value is the percent luminance. A lumMod value of "60000",
     * is 60% of the luminance of the original color.
     * When the color is a shade of the original theme color, the lumMod
     * attribute is the only one of the tags shown here that appears.
     * The <a:lumOff> tag appears after the <a:lumMod> tag when the color is a
     * tint of the original. The lumOff value always equals 1-lumMod, which is used in the tint calculation
     *
     * Despite having different ways to display the tint and shade percentages,
     * all of the programs use the same method to calculate the resulting color.
     * Convert the original RGB value to HSL ... and then adjust the luminance (L)
     * with one of the following equations before converting the HSL value back to RGB.
     * (The % tint in the following equations refers to the tint, themetint, themeshade,
     * or lumMod values, as applicable.)
     *
     * @param hsl the hsl values
     * @param hslPart the hsl part to modify [0..2]
     * @param mod the modulation adjustment
     * @param off the offset adjustment
