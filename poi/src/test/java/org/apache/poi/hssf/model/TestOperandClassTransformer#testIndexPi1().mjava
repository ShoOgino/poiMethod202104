    /**
     * In the example: <code>INDEX(PI(),1)</code>, Excel encodes PI() as 'array'.  It is not clear
     * what rule justifies this. POI currently encodes it as 'value' which Excel(2007) seems to
     * tolerate. Changing the metadata for INDEX to have first parameter as 'array' class breaks
     * other formulas involving INDEX.  It seems like a special case needs to be made.  Perhaps an
     * important observation is that INDEX is one of very few functions that returns 'reference' type.
     * <p>
     * This test has been added but disabled in order to document this issue.
