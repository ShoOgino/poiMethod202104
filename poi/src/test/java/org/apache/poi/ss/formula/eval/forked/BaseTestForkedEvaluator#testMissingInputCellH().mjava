	/**
	 * As of Sep 2009, the Forked evaluator can update values from existing cells (this is because
	 * the underlying 'master' cell is used as a key into the calculation cache.  Prior to the fix
	 * for this bug, an attempt to update a missing cell would result in NPE.  This junit tests for
	 * a more meaningful error message.<br>
	 *
	 * An alternate solution might involve allowing empty cells to be created as necessary.  That
	 * was considered less desirable because so far, the underlying 'master' workbook is strictly
	 * <i>read-only</i> with respect to the ForkedEvaluator.
