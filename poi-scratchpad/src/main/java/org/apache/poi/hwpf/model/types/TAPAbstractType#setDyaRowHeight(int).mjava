     * When greater than 0, guarantees that the height of the table will be at least dyaRowHeight high. When less than 0, guarantees that the height of the table will be exactly absolute value of dyaRowHeight high. When 0, table will be given a height large enough to represent all of the text in all of the cells of the table. Cells with vertical text flow make no contribution to the computation of the height of rows with auto or at least height. Neither do vertically merged cells, except in the last row of the vertical merge. If an auto height row consists entirely of cells which have vertical text direction or are vertically merged, and the row does not contain the last cell in any vertical cell merge, then the row is given height equal to that of the end of cell mark in the first cell..
