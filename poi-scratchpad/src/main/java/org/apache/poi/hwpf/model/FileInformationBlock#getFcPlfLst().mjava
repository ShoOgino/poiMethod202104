     * An unsigned integer that specifies an offset in the Table Stream. A

     * for the array of LVLs. The size of the array of LVLs is specified by the
     * LSTFs in PlfLst. For each LSTF whose fSimpleList is set to 0x1, there is
     * one LVL in the array of LVLs that specifies the level formatting of the
     * single level in the list which corresponds to the LSTF. And, for each
     * LSTF whose fSimpleList is set to 0x0, there are 9 LVLs in the array of
     * LVLs that specify the level formatting of the respective levels in the
     * list which corresponds to the LSTF. This array of LVLs is in the same
     * respective order as the LSTFs in PlfLst. If lcbPlfLst is 0, fcPlfLst is
     * undefined and MUST be ignored.
