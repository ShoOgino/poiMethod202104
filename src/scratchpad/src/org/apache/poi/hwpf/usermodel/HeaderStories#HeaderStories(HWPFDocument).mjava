         * stored in fib.fcPlcfhdd and fib.cbPlcfhdd, describes where the text
         * of each header/footer begins. If there are n headers/footers stored
         * in the Word file, the plcfhdd consists of n+2 CP entries. The
         * beginning CP of the ith header/footer is the ith CP in the plcfhdd.
         * The limit CP (the CP of character 1 position past the end of a
         * header/footer) of the ith header/footer is the i+1st CP in the
         * plcfhdd. Note: at the limit CP - 1, Word always places a chEop as a
         * placeholder which is never displayed as part of the header/footer.
         * This allows Word to change an existing header/footer to be empty.
         * 
         * If there are n header/footers, the n+2nd CP entry value is always 1
         * greater than the n+1st CP entry value. A paragraph end (ASCII 13) is
         * always stored at the file position marked by the n+1st CP value.
         * 
         * The transformation in a full saved file from a header/footer CP to an
         * offset from the beginning of a file (fc) is
         * fc=fib.fcMin+ccpText+ccpFtn+cp."
