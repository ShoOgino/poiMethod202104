    /**
     * Checks to see whether the field - which consists of the formatted
     * contents of an Excel worksheet cell encapsulated within a String - contains
     * any embedded characters that must be escaped. The method is able to
     * comply with either Excel's or UNIX formatting conventions in the
     * following manner;
     *
     * With regard to UNIX conventions, if the field contains any embedded
     * field separator or EOL characters they will each be escaped by prefixing
     * a leading backspace character. These are the only changes that have yet
     * emerged following some research as being required.
     *
     * Excel has other embedded character escaping requirements, some that emerged
     * from empirical testing, other through research. Firstly, with regards to
     * any embedded speech marks ("), each occurrence should be escaped with
     * another speech mark and the whole field then surrounded with speech marks.
     * Thus if a field holds <em>"Hello" he said</em> then it should be modified
     * to appear as <em>"""Hello"" he said"</em>. Furthermore, if the field
     * contains either embedded separator or EOL characters, it should also
     * be surrounded with speech marks. As a result <em>1,400</em> would become
     * <em>"1,400"</em> assuming that the comma is the required field separator.
     * This has one consequence in, if a field contains embedded speech marks
     * and embedded separator characters, checks for both are not required as the
     * additional set of speech marks that should be placed around ay field
     * containing embedded speech marks will also account for the embedded
     * separator.
     *
     * It is worth making one further note with regard to embedded EOL
     * characters. If the data in a worksheet is exported as a CSV file using
     * Excel itself, then the field will be surounded with speech marks. If the
     * resulting CSV file is then re-imports into another worksheet, the EOL
     * character will result in the original simgle field occupying more than
     * one cell. This same 'feature' is replicated in this classes behaviour.
     *
     * @param field An instance of the String class encapsulating the formatted
     *        contents of a cell on an Excel worksheet.
     * @return A String that encapsulates the formatted contents of that
     *         Excel worksheet cell but with any embedded separator, EOL or
     *         speech mark characters correctly escaped.
