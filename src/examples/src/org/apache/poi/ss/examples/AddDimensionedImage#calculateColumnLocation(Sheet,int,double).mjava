     * If the image is to overlie more than one column, calculations need to be
     * performed to determine how many columns and whether the image will
     * overlie just a part of one column in order to be presented at the
     * required size.
     *
     * @param sheet The sheet that will 'contain' the image.
     * @param startingColumn A primitive int whose value is the index of the
     *                       column that contains the cell whose top left hand
     *                       corner should be aligned with the top left hand
     *                       corner of the image.
     * @param reqImageWidthMM A primitive double whose value will indicate the
     *                        required width of the image in millimetres.
     * @return An instance of the ClientAnchorDetail class that will contain
     *         the index number of the column containing the cell whose top
     *         left hand corner also defines the top left hand corner of the
     *         image, the index number column containing the cell whose top
     *         left hand corner also defines the bottom right hand corner of
     *         the image and an inset that determines how far the right hand
     *         edge of the image can protrude into the next column - expressed
     *         as a specific number of co-ordinate positions.
