	/**
	 * Used to decide whether sheet names like 'AB123' need delimiting due to the fact that they 
	 * look like cell references.
	 * <p/>
	 * This code is currently being used for translating formulas represented with <code>Ptg</code>
	 * tokens into human readable text form.  In formula expressions, a sheet name always has a 
	 * trailing '!' so there is little chance for ambiguity.  It doesn't matter too much what this 
	 * method returns but it is worth noting the likely consumers of these formula text strings:
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>POI's own formula parser</li>
	 * <li>Visual reading by human</li>
	 * <li>VBA automation entry into Excel cell contents e.g.  ActiveCell.Formula = "=c64!A1"</li>
	 * <li>Manual entry into Excel cell contents</li>
	 * <li>Some third party formula parser</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * 
	 * At the time of writing, POI's formula parser tolerates cell-like sheet names in formulas
	 * with or without delimiters.  The same goes for Excel(2007), both manual and automated entry.  
	 * <p/>
	 * For better or worse this implementation attempts to replicate Excel's formula renderer.
	 * Excel uses range checking on the apparent 'row' and 'column' components.  Note however that
	 * the maximum sheet size varies across versions.
