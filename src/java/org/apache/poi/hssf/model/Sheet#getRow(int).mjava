     * This method is "loc" sensitive.  Meaning you need to set LOC to where you

     * at what this sets it to.  For this method, set loc to dimsloc to start with.
     * subsequent calls will return rows in (physical) sequence or NULL when you get to the end.
     *

     * @return RowRecord representing the next row record or NULL if there are no more
