     * Get all the value records (from LOC). Records will be returned from the first

     * <P>
     * This method is "loc" sensitive.  Meaning you need to set LOC to where you
     * want it to start searching.  If you don't know do this: setLoc(getDimsLoc).
     * When adding several rows you can just start at the last one by leaving loc
     * at what this sets it to.  For this method, set loc to dimsloc to start with,
     * subsequent calls will return values in (physical) sequence or NULL when you get to the end.

     * @return Array of CellValueRecordInterface representing the remaining value records
     * @deprecated use {@link #getCellValueIterator()} instead
