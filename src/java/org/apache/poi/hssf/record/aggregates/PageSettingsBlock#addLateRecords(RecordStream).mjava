	/**
	 * This method reads PageSettingsBlock records from the supplied RecordStream until the first
	 * non-PageSettingsBlock record is encountered.  As each record is read, it is incorporated
	 * into this PageSettingsBlock.
	 * <p/>
	 * The latest Excel version seems to write the PageSettingsBlock uninterrupted. However there
	 * are several examples (that Excel reads OK) where these records are not written together:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><b>HEADER_FOOTER(0x089C) after WINDOW2</b> - This record is new in 2007.  Some apps
	 * seem to have scattered this record long after the PageSettingsBlock where it belongs
	 * test samples: SharedFormulaTest.xls, ex44921-21902.xls, ex42570-20305.xls</li>
	 * <li><b>PLS, WSBOOL, PageSettingsBlock</b> - WSBOOL is not a PSB record.
	 * This happens in the test sample file "NoGutsRecords.xls" and "WORKBOOK_in_capitals.xls"</li>
	 * <li><b>Margins after DIMENSION</b> - All of PSB should be before DIMENSION. (Bug-47199)</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * These were probably written by other applications (or earlier versions of Excel). It was
	 * decided to not write specific code for detecting each of these cases.  POI now tolerates
	 * PageSettingsBlock records scattered all over the sheet record stream, and in any order, but
	 * does not allow duplicates of any of those records.
	 *
	 * <p/>
	 * <b>Note</b> - when POI writes out this PageSettingsBlock, the records will always be written
	 * in one consolidated block (in the standard ordering) regardless of how scattered the records
	 * were when they were originally read.
	 *
	 * @throws  RecordFormatException if any PSB record encountered has the same type (sid) as
	 * a record that is already part of this PageSettingsBlock
