	 * This method reads {@link WorksheetProtectionBlock} records from the supplied RecordStream
	 * until the first non-WorksheetProtectionBlock record is encountered. As each record is read,
	 * it is incorporated into this WorksheetProtectionBlock.
	 * <p/>
	 * As per the OOO documentation, the protection block records can be expected to be written
	 * together (with no intervening records), but earlier versions of POI (prior to Jun 2009)
	 * didn't do this.  Workbooks with sheet protection created by those earlier POI versions
	 * seemed to be valid (Excel opens them OK). So PO allows continues to support reading of files
	 * with non continuous worksheet protection blocks.
	 *
	 * <p/>
	 * <b>Note</b> - when POI writes out this WorksheetProtectionBlock, the records will always be
	 * written in one consolidated block (in the standard ordering) regardless of how scattered the
	 * records were when they were originally read.
