	 *
	 * The return value provides a means of non-error termination with a 
	 * user-defined result code. A value of zero must be returned to 
	 * continue processing, any other value will halt processing by
	 * <code>HSSFEventFactory</code> with the code being passed back by 
	 * its abortable process events methods.
	 * 
	 * Error termination can be done by throwing the HSSFUserException.
	 *
	 * Note that HSSFEventFactory will not call the inherited process 
	 *
     * @return result code of zero for continued processing.
     *
	 * @throws HSSFUserException User code can throw this to abort 
	 * file processing by HSSFEventFactory and return diagnostic information.
