	 * Test for bug # 48898 - problem opening an OLE2
	 *  file where the last block is short (i.e. not a full
	 *  multiple of 512 bytes)
	 *
	 * As yet, this problem remains. One school of thought is
	 *  not not issue an EOF when we discover the last block
	 *  is short, but this seems a bit wrong.
	 * The other is to fix the handling of the last block in
	 *  POIFS, since it seems to be slight wrong
