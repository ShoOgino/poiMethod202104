	/**
	 * Test PropertyTable
	 * <p>
	 * Running individual tests of the PropertyTable methods, which is the
	 * traditional way to write unit tests (at least for me), seems somewhat
	 * useless in this case. Of greater relevance: if one follows the normal
	 * steps of creating a PropertyTable, and then checking the output, does it
	 * make sense? In other words, more of an integration test.
	 * <p>
	 * So, the test consists of creating a PropertyTable instance, adding three
	 * DocumentProperty instances to it, and then getting the output (including
	 * the preWrite phase first), and comparing it against a real property table
	 * extracted from a file known to be acceptable to Excel.
