	/**
	 * Bugzilla 47479 was due to an apparent error in OOO which (as of version 3.0.1)
	 * writes the <i>value</i> field of BOOLERR records as 2 bytes instead of 1.<br>
	 * Coincidentally, the extra byte written is zero, which is exactly the value
	 * required by the <i>isError</i> field.  This probably why Excel seems to have
	 * no problem.  OOO does not have the same bug for error values (which wouldn't
	 * work by the same coincidence).
