	/**
	 * Sometimes the 'shared formula' flag (<tt>FormulaRecord.isSharedFormula()</tt>) is set when
	 * there is no corresponding SharedFormulaRecord available. SharedFormulaRecord definitions do
	 * not span multiple sheets.  They are are only defined within a sheet, and thus they do not
	 * have a sheet index field (only row and column range fields).<br/>
	 * So it is important that the code which locates the SharedFormulaRecord for each
	 * FormulaRecord does not allow matches across sheets.</br>
	 *
	 * Prior to bugzilla 44449 (Feb 2008), POI <tt>ValueRecordsAggregate.construct(int, List)</tt>
	 * allowed <tt>SharedFormulaRecord</tt>s to be erroneously used across sheets.  That incorrect
	 * behaviour is shown by this test.<p/>
	 *
	 * <b>Notes on how to produce the test spreadsheet</b>:</p>
	 * The setup for this test (AbnormalSharedFormulaFlag.xls) is rather fragile, insomuchas
	 * re-saving the file (either with Excel or POI) clears the flag.<br/>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>A new spreadsheet was created in Excel (File | New | Blank Workbook).</li>
	 * <li>Sheet3 was deleted.</li>
	 * <li>Sheet2!A1 formula was set to '="second formula"', and fill-dragged through A1:A8.</li>
	 * <li>Sheet1!A1 formula was set to '="first formula"', and also fill-dragged through A1:A8.</li>
	 * <li>Four rows on Sheet1 "5" through "8" were deleted ('delete rows' alt-E D, not 'clear' Del).</li>
	 * <li>The spreadsheet was saved as AbnormalSharedFormulaFlag.xls.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * Prior to the row delete action the spreadsheet has two <tt>SharedFormulaRecord</tt>s. One
	 * for each sheet. To expose the bug, the shared formulas have been made to overlap.<br/>
	 * The row delete action (as described here) seems to to delete the
	 * <tt>SharedFormulaRecord</tt> from Sheet1 (but not clear the 'shared formula' flags.<br/>
	 * There are other variations on this theme to create the same effect.
