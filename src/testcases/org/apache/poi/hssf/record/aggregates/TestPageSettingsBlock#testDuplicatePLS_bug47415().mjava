	 * Apparently it's OK to have more than one PLS record.
	 * Attachment 23866 from bug 47415 had a PageSettingsBlock with two PLS records.  This file
	 * seems to open OK in Excel(2007) but both PLS records are removed (perhaps because the
	 * specified printers were not available on the testing machine).  Since the example file does
	 * not upset Excel, POI will preserve multiple PLS records.</p>
	 *
	 * As of June 2009, PLS is still uninterpreted by POI
