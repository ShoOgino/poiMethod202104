     * Whether the bold property shall be applied to all non-complex script
     * characters in the contents of this run when displayed in a document.
     * <p>
     * This formatting property is a toggle property, which specifies that its
     * behavior differs between its use within a style definition and its use as
     * direct formatting. When used as part of a style definition, setting this
     * property shall toggle the current state of that property as specified up
     * to this point in the hierarchy (i.e. applied to not applied, and vice
     * versa). Setting it to <code>false</code> (or an equivalent) shall
     * result in the current setting remaining unchanged. However, when used as
     * direct formatting, setting this property to true or false shall set the
     * absolute state of the resulting property.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the
     * formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this
     * element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then bold shall not be
     * applied to non-complex script characters.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param value <code>true</code> if the bold property is applied to
     *              this run
