     * behaviour differs between its use within a style definition and its use as
     * direct formatting. When used as part of a style definition, setting this
     * property shall toggle the current state of that property as specified up
     * to this point in the hierarchy (i.e. applied to not applied, and vice
     * versa). Setting it to false (or an equivalent) shall result in the
     * current setting remaining unchanged. However, when used as direct
     * formatting, setting this property to true or false shall set the absolute
     * state of the resulting property.
