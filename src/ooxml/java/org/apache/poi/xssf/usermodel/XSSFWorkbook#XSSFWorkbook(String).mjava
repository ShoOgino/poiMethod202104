    /**
     * Constructs a XSSFWorkbook object given a file name.
     *
     * <p>
     *  This constructor is deprecated since POI-3.8 because it does not close
     *  the underlying .zip file stream. In short, there are two ways to open a OPC package:
     * </p>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>
     *      from file which leads to invoking java.util.zip.ZipFile(File file)
     *      deep in POI internals.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *     from input stream in which case we first read everything into memory and
     *     then pass the data to ZipInputStream.
     *     </li>
     * <ol>
     * <p>    
     *     It should be noted, that (2) uses quite a bit more memory than (1), which
     *      doesn't need to hold the whole zip file in memory, and can take advantage
     *      of native methods.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *   To construct a workbook from file use the
     *   {@link #XSSFWorkbook(org.apache.poi.openxml4j.opc.OPCPackage)}  constructor:
     *   <pre><code>
     *       OPCPackage pkg = OPCPackage.open(path);
     *       XSSFWorkbook wb = new XSSFWorkbook(pkg);
     *       // work with the wb object
     *       ......
     *       pkg.close(); // gracefully closes the underlying zip file
     *   </code></pre>     
     * </p>
     * 
     * @param      path   the file name.
     * @deprecated
     */
