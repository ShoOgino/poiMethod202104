     * Returns a value rounded to p digits after decimal.
     * If p is negative, then the number is rounded to
     * places to the left of the decimal point. eg.
     * 10.23 rounded to -1 will give: 10. If p is zero,
     * the returned value is rounded to the nearest integral
     * value.
     * <p>If n is negative, the resulting value is obtained
     * as the round-up value of absolute value of n multiplied
     * by the sign value of n (@see MathX.sign(double d)).
     * Thus, -0.8 rounded-down to p=0 will give 0 not -1.
     * <p>If n is NaN, returned value is NaN.
     * @param n
     * @param p
