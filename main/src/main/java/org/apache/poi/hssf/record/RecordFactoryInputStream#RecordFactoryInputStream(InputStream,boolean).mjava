		* How to recognise end of stream?
		* In the best case, the underlying input stream (in) ends just after the last EOF record
		* Usually however, the stream is padded with an arbitrary byte count.  Excel and most apps
		* reliably use zeros for padding and if this were always the case, this code could just
		* skip all the (zero sized) records with sid==0.  However, bug 46987 shows a file with
		* non-zero padding that is read OK by Excel (Excel also fixes the padding).
		*
		* So to properly detect the workbook end of stream, this code has to identify the last
		* EOF record.  This is not so easy because the worbook bof+eof pair do not bracket the
		* whole stream.  The worksheets follow the workbook, but it is not easy to tell how many
		* sheet sub-streams should be present.  Hence we are looking for an EOF record that is not
		* immediately followed by a BOF record.  One extra complication is that bof+eof sub-
		* streams can be nested within worksheet streams and it's not clear in these cases what
		* record might follow any EOF record.  So we also need to keep track of the bof/eof
		* nesting level.
