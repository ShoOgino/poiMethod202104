    /**
     * Bugzilla attachment 23444 (from bug 46973) has a NAME record with the following encoding:
     * <pre>
     * 00000000 | 18 00 17 00 00 00 00 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 | ................
     * 00000010 | 00 00 00 55 50 53 53 74 61 74 65                | ...UPSState
     * </pre>
     *
     * This caused trouble for anything that requires {@link Name#getRefersToFormula()}
     * It is easy enough to re-create the the same data (by not setting the formula). Excel
     * seems to gracefully remove this uninitialized name record.  It would be nice if POI
     * could do the same, but that would involve adjusting subsequent name indexes across
     * all formulas. <p>
     *
     * For the moment, POI has been made to behave more sensibly with uninitialized name
     * records.
