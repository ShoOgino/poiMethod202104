		ex45978-extraLinkTableSheets.xls is a cut-down version of attachment 22561.
		The original file produces the same error.

		This bug was caused by a combination of invalid sheet indexes in the EXTERNSHEET
		record, and eager initialisation of the extern sheet references. Note - the workbook
		has 2 sheets, but the EXTERNSHEET record refers to sheet indexes 0, 1 and 2.

		Offset 0x3954 (14676)
		recordid = 0x17, size = 32
		[EXTERNSHEET]
		   numOfRefs	 = 5
		refrec		 #0: extBook=0 firstSheet=0 lastSheet=0
		refrec		 #1: extBook=1 firstSheet=2 lastSheet=2
		refrec		 #2: extBook=2 firstSheet=1 lastSheet=1
		refrec		 #3: extBook=0 firstSheet=-1 lastSheet=-1
		refrec		 #4: extBook=0 firstSheet=1 lastSheet=1
		[/EXTERNSHEET]

		As it turns out, the formula in question doesn't even use externSheetIndex #1 - it
		uses #4, which resolves to sheetIndex 1 -> 'Data'.

		It is not clear exactly what externSheetIndex #4 would refer to.  Excel seems to
		display such a formula as "''!$A2", but then complains of broken link errors.

		// Bug: IndexOutOfBoundsException - Index: 2, Size: 2
		String cellFormula = cell.getCellFormula();
